# Environment Setup Improvements

## Current Limitations
- Environment variables only set up for database package
- Manual process required when Supabase isn't running
- No support for multiple environments (dev/test/prod)
- Limited error handling
- Other packages need separate environment configuration

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Centralized Environment Management
- Create a root-level `.env` file that all packages can access
- Use a tool like `dotenv-flow` to support environment inheritance
- Implement a monorepo-wide script to gather all environment variables

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Add retries for Supabase connection
- Add graceful fallback to defaults when services aren't available
- Provide clearer error messages with troubleshooting steps

### 3. Multi-Environment Support
- Add `.env.development`, `.env.test`, and `.env.production`
- Support Docker environment variable injection
- Create environment switching commands

### 4. Automatic Database Management
- Add automatic schema migrations on startup
- Include seed data for development environments
- Add database backup/restore commands

### 5. Developer Experience
- Add visual feedback during environment setup (progress bars)
- Create a dashboard command to view all environment variables
- Add validation for required environment variables
- Create a self-diagnosis tool for environment issues

### 6. Security Improvements
- Add environment variable encryption for sensitive data
- Implement .env.example with placeholder values
- Add validation for security-critical variables

### 7. CI/CD Integration
- Generate environment files during CI/CD pipeline
- Add environment validation in pre-commit hooks
- Create environment diff tool for debugging

### 8. Docker Workflow Integration
- Pass environment variables directly to Docker containers
- Create Docker-specific env files
- Implement health checks to ensure services are ready

### 9. Cross-Package Environment Sharing
- Create a shared environment package all components can import
- Implement a centralized environment service with API
- Support dynamic environment updates without restarts

### 10. Monitoring & Debugging
- Add logging for environment variable access
- Create environment snapshots for debugging
- Add environment variable history tracking
