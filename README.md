# **Strapex - Open Source Alternative to Stripe**

Strapex is an open-source payment gateway inspired by Stripe, designed to democratize access to a free, secure, and decentralized way of transacting with businesses. By leveraging Starknet, Strapex enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, while offering the enhanced user experience that Starknet provides.

## **⚠️ Important Considerations**

Due to the transparent nature of blockchain, all transactions are publicly visible on the network. This transparency allows for the tracking of individual purchases and business revenue, which may impact privacy for both customers and businesses.

```sh
cp packages/database/supabase/.env.example packages/database/supabase/.env
cp apps/www/.env.example apps/www/.env
```

## **Database Setup**

cd packages/database && pnpx supabase start

Note: First-time startup may take several minutes as it downloads Docker images and sets up services.

We use Docker to launch every components of Strapex in development mode, make sure to install Docker on your system then run `docker compose up` in the root directory.
This command will launch everything needed to work with Strapex:

- Katana (Starknet Devnet) at http://localhost:5050 along with an explorer at http://localhost:5050/explorer
- Supabase local development studio at http://localhost:8082
- Strapex frontend at http://localhost:3333

To interact with the Strapex contracts in the frontend, you will need to add the Katana Devnet in your Wallet networks:

- Network name: Katana
- Chain ID: KATANA
- RPC URL: http://localhost:5050
- Account class hash: 0x07dc7899aa655b0aae51eadff6d801a58e97dd99cf4666ee59e704249e51adf2
- Fee Token Address: 0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d
- Block explorer URL: http://localhost:5050/explorer

### **Viewing and importing Katana accounts**

To view all pre-deployed Katana accounts and their private keys, run:

```sh
docker compose logs katana | grep -A 2 -B 2 "Private key"
```

This will display all available accounts with their addresses, private keys, and public keys.

Then import one of Katana predeployed funded accounts in your Wallet using its private key:

```
| Account address |  0x127fd5f1fe78a71f8bcd1fec63e3fe2f0486b6ecd5c86a0466c3a21fa5cfcec
| Private key     |  0xc5b2fcab997346f3ea1c00b002ecf6f382c5f9c9659a3894eb783c5320f912
| Public key      |  0x33246ce85ebdc292e6a5c5b4dd51fab2757be34b8ffda847ca6925edf31cb67
