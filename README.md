# Strapex - Open Source alternative to Stripe

Strapex is an open-source payment gateway inspired by Stripe, designed to democratize access to a free, secure, and decentralized way of transacting with businesses. By leveraging Starknet, Strapex enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, while offering the enhanced user experience that Starknet provides.


## ⚠️ Important Considerations
Due to the transparent nature of blockchain, all transactions are publicly visible on the network. This transparency allows for the tracking of individual purchases and business revenue, which may impact privacy for both customers and businesses.
